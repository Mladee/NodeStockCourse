After creating the git repository we will want to:

1.Add all of them : git add . <- the "." means add EVERYTHING
2.Commit all of those(to save them): git commit -am 'initial commit' <- that is a description
3.Make a hidden directory for our secure key: mkdir ~/.ssh
4.Move to that directory: cd ~/.ssh
5.Now we want to generate our ssh key in this folder: ssh-keygen.exe.We can then check if it was succesful with "ls".
6.Then we get our key: cat id_rsa.pub <- cat stands for catalog
7.Next we go to github and create a new SSH key by using copy paste on the ssh key that was generated at 6.
8.Now we will create a repository  and after creating it we will copy paste into the bash terminal the 3 lines of code provided by github.
9.Success


If we want to add changes to the code and commit it again with the new changes:

1.Add all of them : git add .
2.Commit all of those(to save them): git commit -am 'literally any comment you want'
3.Push all the stuff : git push
4.Refresh the github page
